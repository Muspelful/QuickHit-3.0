/*
 * Just various constants in case I ever need to change them.
 * 
 * If the max number of units ever changes (which is highly unlikely), in addition to changing the constant here, the macro generator would need to be rewritten for the new positions of unit buttons for various slots.
 * The chain visualizer would also need to be made vertically larger to accomodate more units.
 * The window would need to be made wider to so that the additional units aren't off the screen. (Consider the width of most monitors, this would probably require a complete redesign of the UI.)
 * 
 * To add a new family, three things must be done:
 * 1. Add the new family's name to both CHAIN_FAMILY_NAMES and FIRST_CAST_CHAIN_FAMILY_NAMES.
 * 2. Add the new family's frames and cast time as constants.
 * 3. Add a new case to the switch statement in itemStateChanged in Skill.java with the family name as the case, and make it so that said case sets the frames and the cast time to the appropriate constants.
