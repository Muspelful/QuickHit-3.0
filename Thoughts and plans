Todo:

Unit will need some rewrites to allow the replacement of the "middle" skills.
Implement "removeSkill(int slot)" in unit, which trims off that slot and all subsequent casts.
Implement a skill factory of some sort for families.
Figure out how Chain is going to talk to Unit.

Ideas/thoughts:

Use a factory for skills?

Set combo boxes to "None" and disable them if the previous box is none.
